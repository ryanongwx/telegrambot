# Telegrambot
@WhenDavai_bot

This telegram bot was designed to be use by groups of people for the purpose of finding common time slots for group meetings or group activities.
In this day and age where everyone finds themselves constantly occupied with work and other commitments, this telegram bot provides them with a platform
to easily organise meetings for all to meet for some recreational and relaxation time, or simply some bonding time with their friends.

This telegram bot takes the users' free times as its input and will store them in a database. It then consolidates the free times of all members within
the group and proposes the perfect day in which most of the people within the group are free. Additionally, should the groups choose not to organise
the meeting on that day, the bot will display all the data input by their group members in a table format in order for them to decide based on
which group member is free on which days.

This reduces the hassle of groups from having to compile the free times of everyone manually, which is at times very tedious and time-consuming.
Take this bot for a spin and have a hassle-free group activity organised by the WhenDavai? Bot!

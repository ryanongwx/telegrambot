Telegram Bot

How it works:

Simple Telegram bot project which is a bot which takes as input the time in which various users are free.
The bot then stores the schedule in a database which is hosted on Heroku Postgresql servers.
An algorithm then identifies and compiles then time periods in which users are free.
The output will be a timetable-like output which shows which users are free during which time periods.
